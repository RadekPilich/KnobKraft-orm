## Features:

* asd

## Synths:

* **\#428** Fixed tag import for the Generic Roland module, preventing tag import e.g. for JV-2080 to work. Thanks to @ivruebj for finding it
and providing the fix!

## Bug fixes:

* **\#386** Fixed deleting patches which were part of a synth bank via the menu. This did throw an error message and would just refuse
to delete the patches. This new version allows to delete the patches also if they are part of a user list via the Edit... Delete... menu item -
if a patch is part of a bank though it is hidden not and not deleted, as the bank structure needs to remain intact. Thanks to @RadekPilich for reporting!
* **\#425** Fixed text message on import that was confusing. Thanks @markusschlosser!
* Patch button in current patch side bar did not show color anymore. Fixed.
